# Grind Manager

Just messing around with obsidian plugin development to implement my own task manager inside obsidian.

## Build

```bash
# build plugin
pnpm build
# don't forget to copy files
cp build/* $YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/personal-grind-manager/
```

## Docs

```bash
# generate docs
pnpm run docs
```

## Inspiration

- [obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)
- [obsidian-pomodoro-timer](https://github.com/eatgrass/obsidian-pomodoro-timer)

## Can I contribute?

Yes, of course!
