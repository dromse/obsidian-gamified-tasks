# Gamified Tasks Core

This folder contains the core resources for gamified tasks. What does that mean? It stores the business logic for gamified tasks, independent of the Obsidian plugin. The library provides a foundation for creating gamified tasks, which can be implemented on various platforms.

You can use this library to build your own gamified task manager, whether it's a CLI tool, a React Native app, or any other platform. It offers the flexibility to interact with tasks outside of the Obsidian ecosystem.
